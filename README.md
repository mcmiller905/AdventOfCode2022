mcmiller905's repository for Advent of Code 2022 work. I'm still using Python, this is a good way to practice with it. I have a 'main.py' file, that serves as the main starting point for each day of code. There is a variable at the top of the file that determines which day's code should be run. Each day's code is stored in a DayCode directory, and the same is true for the input files in InputFiles.

If you want to run it, there are 3 variables at the top of *main.py* that control what day and part get run. Set "day" to the number of the day you want to run (or 0 to run all in succession) and set "runPart1" and "runPart2" to True if you want to run their respective parts.
